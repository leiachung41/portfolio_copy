# Project: Neighbourhood Map
I will develop a single-page application featuring a map of my neighbourhood or a neighbourhood I would like to visit.

## Project Goals

-  I will then add additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places Iâ€™d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a list view to support simple browsing of all locations.
-  I will then research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations. (such as Street View images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc.)

## Project Details
**1. Knockout framework**

- I made a neighborhood map and bound index.html and app.js using Knockout.js.
- I connected my locations with google maps markers. And also I made a filter to search my locations.

**2. Google Maps API**

- I got a google maps API key and using to load map with my locations.
- I made markers to display my locations and show their own information.

**3. FourSquare API**

- I used FourSquare API as third party API.
- All information about my locations are from FourSquare.

## How to download the Application
1. You can download the repository from [here](https://github.com/leachung41/NeighbourhoodMap).
2. Find a index.html file in the repository, and open the index.html file in a browser.

*Or you can connect to the application via online [https://leachung41.github.io/NeighbourhoodMap/](https://leachung41.github.io/NeighbourhoodMap/).*

## How to use the Application
- If you click a marker on the map, it shows its information from FourSquare.
- If you search a location on the list in a search box, it shows the result both list view and map.
