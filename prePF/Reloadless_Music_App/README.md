# Project: Reloadless Music App

## Description

I practiced JavaScript skills to make a music app that doesn't need to reload the music between pages.

## Built with

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery

## Installation

1. You can download the repository from
[Portfolio/Reloadless_Music_App/](https://github.com/leachung/Portfolio/tree/master/Reloadless_Music_App/).
2. Find a index.html file in the repository, and open the index.html file in a browser.

*Or you can connect to the application via online here [Reloadless Music App](https://leachung.github.io/Portfolio/Reloadless_Music_App/index.html).*

## How to use?

  -  If you play or stop the music and at the same time click the page2, the music is not stopping or replaying and the site is not refreshing.
