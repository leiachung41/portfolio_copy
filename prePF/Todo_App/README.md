This is practice on MVC pattern using this [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) site. This is the sample [todos](http://todomvc.com/examples/backbone/) site using BackboneJS. I modified some features of this [basic todo app](https://leiachung.github.io/Portfolio/Todo_App/before/index.html).

## How to use?
