# Project: Build a Portfolio Site

## Description

For this project, I built a portfolio website. I was given a [design mockup](https://leachung.github.io/Portfolio/Build_a_Portfolio_Site/before/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf) as a PDF file, and replicated that design in HTML and CSS. I developed a responsive website that displays images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects.

## Built with

HTML, CSS, Grunt, Responsive web

## Installation

1. You can download the repository from
[Portfolio/Build_a_Portfolio_Site/](https://github.com/leachung/Portfolio/tree/master/Build_a_Portfolio_Site/).
2. Find a index.html file in the repository, and open the index.html file in a browser.

*Or you can connect to the application via online here [Build a Portfolio Site](https://leachung.github.io/Portfolio/Build_a_Portfolio_Site/index.html).*

## How to use?

  - When you click the logo, it will link the index.html.
  - It is responsive website so it can resize and reorganize with the window size.
  - If you click the title of the featured works, it will link their work page.
