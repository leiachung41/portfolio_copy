# Project: My Responsive Blog

## Description

This is a responsive blog I developed as a result of practice like this [index.html](https://leachung.github.io/Portfolio/My_Responsive_Blog/before/index_B4.html). I used the picture element for art direction: different image crops are loaded, depending on viewport size.

## Built with

1. You can download the repository from
[Portfolio/My_Responsive_Blog/](https://github.com/leachung/Portfolio/tree/master/My_Responsive_Blog/).
