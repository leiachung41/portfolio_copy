# Project: Mock-up to Article

## Description

This project is translating a mock-up to HTML. I was given a [mock-up](https://leachung.github.io/Portfolio/Mockup_to_Article/before/blog-mockup.pdf) of a website and a [index.html](https://leachung.github.io/Portfolio/Mockup_to_Article/before/index_B4.html) file (a copy of the text in it). I recreated it with HTML.
