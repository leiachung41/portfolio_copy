# Project: Animal Trading Cards

## Description

This project is re-creating a webpage from a design prototype. I was given a design prototype and a index.html. The design prototype used in this project is inspired by trading cards and features a fish from a popular animated film. I created the card and swapped out the fish with an animal of my choice.
